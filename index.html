            <h2 class="story-title1">Our Story</h2>
            <p class="story-text">We met each other for the first time on Sunday, in church. I remember the day quite vividly, but it never occurred to me that she would be my wife. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="story-text2"><i>There were no bells or whistles. I had seen him in the pictures my brother posted on Facebook.</i></p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="story-text">Fast forward a couple of years and we struck up a conversation in the church van. (I know, the church again, but negodu Jesus) It turned out that we had a lot in common, from our values to our aspirations. She was even taking a course that I had previously taken. So, we bonded over test scores, labs and biochemistry. It was a great conversation I hoped would continue and it continued. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="story-text">I began seeing all the virtues she encompassed, her kind heart, her dedication, her patience and ability to be unfazed during trying times, her great faith in God. I didn’t get a vision, I didn’t see her in my dreams but I had a specific prayer request whenever I prayed concerning my future wife: I prayed that I would recognize the bone of my bone when I met her and she would recognize me. I realized somewhere during our conversations that I had found the one. So, when I professed my love to her and she didn’t give me an answer, I wasn’t worried. I knew she was the one.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="story-text2"><i>I had started praying for my future husband from an early age, my prayers were intentional, consistent and direct. I asked the Lord to guard his heart and make him a man of integrity amongst other things. So, when he asked me to marry him, I had to go back and check and double-check to see if this man in front of me lined up with the man I had been praying for. It was during one of these prayer sessions the Lord opened my eyes to see that he was my walking, breathing answered prayers.</i></p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="story-text2"><i>Bone recognized bone and flesh recognized flesh. I feel grateful to know that I would be married to my best friend - the one I laugh with, dream with, pray with and love.</i></p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="story-text">I have found my good thing. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="story-text2"><i>I have found my forever.</i></p>
